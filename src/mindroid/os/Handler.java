/**
 * A Handler allows you to send and process {@link Message} and Runnable objects associated with a
 * thread's {@link MessageQueue}. Each Handler instance is associated with a single thread and that
 * thread's message queue. When you create a new Handler, it is bound to the thread / message queue
 * of the thread that is creating it -- from that point on, it will deliver messages and runnables
 * to that message queue and execute them as they come out of the message queue.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are two main uses for a Handler: (1) to schedule messages and runnables to be executed as
 * some point in the future; and (2) to enqueue an action to be performed on a different thread than
 * your own.
 *
 * <p>
 * Scheduling messages is accomplished with the {@link #post}, {@link #postAtTime(Runnable, long)},
 * {@link #postDelayed}, {@link #sendEmptyMessage}, {@link #sendMessage}, {@link #sendMessageAtTime}
 * , and {@link #sendMessageDelayed} methods. The <em>post</em> versions allow you to enqueue
 * Runnable objects to be called by the message queue when they are received; the
 * <em>sendMessage</em> versions allow you to enqueue a {@link Message} object containing a bundle
 * of data that will be processed by the Handler's {@link #handleMessage} method (requiring that you
 * implement a subclass of Handler).
 *
 * <p>
 * When posting or sending to a Handler, you can either allow the item to be processed as soon as
 * the message queue is ready to do so, or specify a delay before it gets processed or absolute time
 * for it to be processed. The latter two allow you to implement timeouts, ticks, and other
 * timing-based behavior.
 *
 * <p>
 * When a process is created for your application, its main thread is dedicated to running a message
 * queue that takes care of managing the top-level application objects (activities, broadcast
 * receivers, etc) and any windows they create. You can create your own threads, and communicate
 * back with the main application thread through a Handler. This is done by calling the same
 * <em>post</em> or <em>sendMessage</em> methods as before, but from your new thread. The given
 * Runnable or Message will then be scheduled in the Handler's message queue and processed when
 * appropriate.
